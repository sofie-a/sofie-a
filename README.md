## Hi 👋  I’m Ann-Sofie 

Welcome to the page of a curious problem solver. I enjoy fighting with terminals and requests because the end result is worth it (atleast almost always 😅)

Check out my project to get a sneak peak into what has been keeping me busy lately 

See you around in the coding universe 👩🏽‍💻
